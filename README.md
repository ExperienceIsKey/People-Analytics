# People-Analytics

The project aimed to develop a predictive analytics solution to forecast voluntary employee churn and optimize Seagateâ€™s two-year hiring pipeline. I cleaned and prepared datasets with over 25,000 employee records, engineered predictive features, and built machine learning models to identify key drivers of churn. Using Python, CatBoost, XGBoost, and AdaBoost in an agile environment, I trained and evaluated models, achieving the highest performance with CatBoost at 77.66% accuracy, a recall of 77%, and an ROC-AUC of 0.86. The analysis projected 1,616 voluntary churn cases over two years, with a financial impact of $66.8 million, providing actionable insights for HR to implement retention strategies and allocate resources efficiently.
