# People-Analytics

My team and I developed a predictive analytics solution to forecast voluntary employee churn and optimize Seagateâ€™s two-year hiring pipeline. Together, we cleaned and prepared datasets with over 25,000 employee records, engineered predictive features, and built machine learning models to identify key drivers of churn. Leveraging Python, CatBoost, XGBoost, and AdaBoost in an agile environment, we achieved the best performance with CatBoost, delivering 77.66% accuracy, a recall of 77%, and an ROC-AUC of 0.86. The analysis projected 1,616 voluntary churn cases over two years, with a financial impact of $66.8 million, empowering HR to implement proactive retention strategies and optimize budget allocation for talent acquisition.
